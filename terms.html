        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

        <p>
          These Terms &amp; Conditions govern your use of Peakora, including the

        </p>

        <h2>1. Purpose of Peakora</h2>
        <p>
          Peakora provides a simple, guided 7&#8209;day reset designed to help
          you feel clearer, calmer, and more grounded. It is not medical advice,
          therapy, or a substitute for professional care.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old to use Peakora. By using the
          service, you confirm that you meet this requirement.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Personal Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for your own choices, actions, and well&#8209;being.
          Peakora provides guidance, not guarantees. You should always listen to
          your body and your circumstances.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Use of the Peakora Agent</h2>
        <p>
          The Peakora agent is designed to offer general guidance and support.
          It does not provide medical, legal, or financial advice. Messages you
          send may be used to respond to your request and improve the service.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Email Communication</h2>
        <p>
          By starting the 7&#8209;day reset, you agree to receive emails related
          to your plan. You may unsubscribe at any time.
        </p>

          Peakora is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranties of any
          kind. We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the
          service, including indirect or incidental damages.
