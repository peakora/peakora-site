                No complicated routines. No guilt. Just small, realistic steps designed for your life.

                <div class="section-label">Why this approach works</div>
                <h2>Small, kind steps create real change</h2>
                <p>
                    Most habit plans fail because they demand too much, too fast. Peakora takes a different path — 
                    it focuses on tiny, consistent actions that are kind to your current energy, time, and capacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By lowering the pressure and making each step feel doable, you’re more likely to show up — 
                    and when you show up, even in small ways, your identity starts to shift. You begin to see yourself 
                    as someone who follows through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s where real, sustainable change begins.

                        Peakora is not about perfection. It’s about showing up in small ways, again and again,
